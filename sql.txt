This is called a relationship , which means that the Address table is related to the Users table.
When defining the table, you need to define the relationship 


CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    pincode VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
); 


Joins 

Whatâ€™s hard is joining  data from two (or more) tables together.

For example, if I ask you to fetch me a users details and  their address, what SQL would you run?

SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, a.city, a.country, a.street, a.pincode
FROM users u
JOIN addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
WHERE u.id = YOUR_USER_ID;
